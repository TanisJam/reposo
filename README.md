# El Reposo Del Cuervo Landing Page

El Reposo Del Cuervo is the name of a Discord server that organizes and run D&D rol sessions. To promote the server, I've created a landing page that includes information about the server, its rules, and how to join. The page is designed to be visually appealing and user-friendly.
This page is built with **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The page adapts to different screen sizes.
- **Interactivity**: Utilizes Next.js capabilities for a smooth user experience.
- **Modern Styling**: Implements Tailwind CSS for an attractive and customizable design.

## Technologies Used

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework for web applications.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/) - A Tailwind CSS component library for faster UI development.
